# Data Science 4 Science (DS4S)

We developed the course in consultation with some of our alumni in the data science industry. We began by asking them, "Knowing what you know now, what do you wish you had known in graduate school because it would have made you a more productive researcher."

The responses were largely a combination of recommendations about best coding practices and soft skills. Notably absent was any emphasis on particular data analysis techniques. It may seem less exciting to focus on things like unit testing and version control, rather than, say, variational auto encoders, but this is the guidance we have and it makes sense; they are pointing us to foundational aspects of research productivity. 

Lessons on Modularity and Testing are based on Adam Rupe's excellent lessons on Scientific Programming in Python https://github.com/adamrupe/Scientific-Python-Tutorials
